### Project Description
[The Dynamic Resume Builder is an interactive web application that allows users to create and download a professional, customizable resume in PDF format. Built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, this tool is designed to simplify the resume creation process by providing a user-friendly interface and dynamic features like adding profile images, bullet-point lists, and neatly formatted sections.]

### The Problem statement
[Job seekers often struggle to create a well-structured, professional, and ATS-friendly resume. Many resumes get rejected by Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) due to poor formatting, incorrect keyword usage, or improper structure. Additionally, not everyone has the design skills or tools to craft a visually appealing and informative resume.

### The Solution
[To address the challenges job seekers face in creating a professional and ATS-friendly resume, the Resume Builder Web Application offers a user-friendly, automated solution that simplifies resume creation, formatting, and customization.
